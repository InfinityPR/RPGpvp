# RPGpvp

This is a script written for the SAES:RPG server. This script introduces a Player V Player system. 

Players are able to create their own private arena to go versus each other. The script can be accessed by typing /pvp where a CEGUI will pop up. The player can choose which game mode he wishes to play against his opponent and both parties upon agreeing to the request, will be teleported into a private arena where the script itself takes over to determine who is the winner.

Upon typing /pvp you will be prompted with the image above. You can choose an online player and select your gamemode.
